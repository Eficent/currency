This module extends the functionality of Accounting to support Foreign
Exchange Spot Transactions. A **Foreign Exchange Spot Transaction**, also
known as FX spot, is an agreement between two parties to buy one currency
against selling another currency at an agreed price for settlement on
the spot date. The exchange rate at which the transaction is done is
called the spot exchange rate.
